# cnc-writing-machine
This project provides a local environment to control a writing/plotting machine using ChiliPeppr as the G-code sender and visual interface, combined with Serial Port JSON Server (SPJS). The system is launched with a single script (run_chillipeppr) that starts all required services and opens the ChiliPeppr interface in a web browser automatically.

# üõ†Ô∏è Local ChiliPeppr & GRBL Firmware

This project provides a fully local environment for controlling a GRBL-based CNC or writing machine. It includes everything needed to run the **ChiliPeppr workspace**, **Serial Port JSON Server (SPJS)**, and a launcher script (run_chillipeppr) found in (chilipeppr_launcher\dist\run_chilipeppr.exe)  to simplify the process.

You can control your plotter, CNC machine, or writing robot directly from your computer using this setup ‚Äî no internet required.
